        in the aforementioned film Ashta Chamma, also starring Swati Reddy.[8] Ashta Chamma was well
        received by critics and Nani's performance was praised by them. Sify.com wrote "Nani has a 
        very good screen presence. He has good emotions and dances well, though his body language sometimes
        reminds of Subhalekha Sudhakar – May this be treated as a compliment to the ease that the veteran
        actor shows on the screen! His addiction is good too."[16][17] His second film, Ride, was produced
        by Bellamkonda Suresh, with Tanish, Swetha Basu Prasad and Aksha Pardasany playing important roles.
        Ride was also a notable success at the box office.[18] He next starred in Satyam Bellamkonda's film

        performance as a spoilt-brat-turned-leader was well appreciated. Radhika Rajamani stated "It is 
        Nani's show all the way. He lives up to the role and is able to portray the kaleidoscope of emotions 
        demanded of him."[29] IndiaGlitz wrote, "Performance-wise, Nani delivers a matured output in the second 
        half as a youth in self-introspecting and self-correcting mode."[30] The film was a hit at the box office, 
        prompting a Tamil dubbed release under the title Jameen.</p>
